								<p>Following the declaration by the Biden administration that US forces would leave Afghanistan, the team banded together to urge the administration to develop and implement a plan to protect the allies who have fought with U.S. troops in Afghanistan for the past two decades.
                                    The organization created a strategy and asking for the rapid evacuation of all Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)-eligible Afghans to US territory, as well as urging the Administration to bring all at-risk Afghans to safety, including those not in the SIV program.</p>
